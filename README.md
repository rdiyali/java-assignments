# Java Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Java projects and assignments from my coursework, focusing on core data structures, algorithms, and other concepts. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of foundational computer science topics.

Contents

  Linked List: Custom implementation of a singly linked list with methods for insertion, deletion, and traversal.
  
  Binary Search Tree (BST): A generic BST implementation for efficient data storage and retrieval.
  
  Bubble Sort: A sorting algorithm implementation that demonstrates the basics of algorithmic design and efficiency.
  
  Undo Calculator: Calculator project with undo functionality implemented using the Memento design pattern.
  
  Vector with Command-Line Arguments: Demonstrates vector usage in Java, with command-line integration for parameter inputs.

Feel free to look the code, fork the repository, or adapt components for your own projects.
