# Java Data Structures and Algorithms
This repository contains a collection of Java projects and assignments from my coursework, focusing on core data structures, algorithms, and other concepts. 
Each project demonstrates practical implementations of foundational computer science topics.

Feel free to look at the code, fork the repository, or adapt components for your projects. feedback is always appreciated. 

Contents
Vector: 
The program counts the frequency of each character in each text 
file(input.txt). and outputs the results to another file (output.txt). The 
program uses a Vector to store unique characters.

Linked List: 
The program counts the frequency of each character in each text 
file(input.txt). and outputs the results to another file (output.txt). The 
program uses a LinkedList to store unique characters and their 
frequencies, with each unique character represented by a CharFreq 
object.

Binary Search Tree (BST): 
The goal of this program is to construct a Binary Search, which includes 
important features like adding components, searching for elements, and 
executing tree traversals (preorder, inorder, postorder). The major use case 
is to manage a collection of components that can be quickly searched, 

Undo Calculator: The goal of this project is to create a basic calculator capable of 
performing basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, and division. Additionally, the calculator will feature an 
undo function that allows users to revert their last operation using 
stacks in java. 
  
Bubble Sort: 
This program is designed to compare the performance of two sorting 
methods Bubble Sort and Java's built-in Collections.sort. The program 
generates a list of 100,000 random integers, sorts it using Bubble Sort, and 
measures the time taken. It then sorts a copy of the list using Collections.sort
and measures the time. The goal is to evaluate the efficiency of Bubble Sort
